# LEMP-Project

LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP)

 I have built a flexible foundation for serving PHP websites and applications to my visitors, using Nginx as web server and MySQL as database management system.

 I launched an EC2 Instance and added the necessary security groups with ubuntu server and ssh with keypair to connect to Ubuntu Server OS.
